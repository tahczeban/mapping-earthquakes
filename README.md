***RESOURCES***
Software: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, VSC, Leaflet, D3.js

Data Source: Mapbox Earthquakes GeoJSON, Earthquakes above 4.5mag GeoJSON, Tectonic Plate GeoJSON

***OVERVIEW***

The purpose of this challenge was to assist Basil and Sadhana create an interactive earthquake map depicting earthquakes, tectonic plates and major earthquakes in 3 different views. Pertinent information was obtained from mapbox API's/GeoJSON in order to visualize earthquake proximity to tectonic plates.

***RESULTS AND SUMMARY***

**DELIVERABLE 1: ADD TECTONIC PLATE DATA**

Tectonic plate data was obtained and added to a map via d3.json() and geoJSON layers with LineString data so the tectonic plates could be observed as an overlay on the map (Figure 1).
