***RESOURCES***
Software: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, VSC, Leaflet, D3.js

Data Source: Mapbox Earthquakes GeoJSON, Earthquakes above 4.5mag GeoJSON, Tectonic Plate GeoJSON

***OVERVIEW***

The purpose of this challenge was to assist Basil and Sadhana create an interactive earthquake map depicting earthquakes, tectonic plates and major earthquakes in 3 different views. Pertinent information was obtained from mapbox API's/GeoJSON in order to visualize earthquake proximity to tectonic plates.

***RESULTS AND SUMMARY***

**DELIVERABLE 1: ADD TECTONIC PLATE DATA**

Tectonic plate data was obtained and added to a map via d3.json() and geoJSON layers with LineString data so the tectonic plates could be observed as an overlay on the map (Figure 1).

**DELIVERABLE 2: ADDING MAJOR EARTHQUAKE DATA**

For this Deliverable, JavaScript, Leaflet.js and geoJSON data were applied to add a layer to the interactive maps, with legend, to illustrate major earthquake data. Pop-up markers were then added to display the magnitude and location of the earthquakes (Figures 2 and 3, respectively).

**Deliverable 3: ADD AN ADDITIONAL MAP**

JavaScript and Leaflet with Mapbox options were incorporated to add a third map view. As you can see in Figure 4, a street, satellite and dark view were added so that the viewer can toggle between the three options for optimal visualizations.
